# Simple-Encryption-Algorithm
This program is an encryption tool that allows the user to encrypt a given string with a series of positive integer keys. The encryption algorithm works by shifting each character in the input string by a certain amount determined by the corresponding key value. The character set used for the encryption includes all alphanumeric characters, punctuation marks, and some special characters. The program prompts the user to enter the input string and a list of keys. After encryption, the program outputs the original and encrypted strings. If the encryption fails due to invalid characters, the program outputs an error message.
